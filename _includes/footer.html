      <h2>About this website</h2>
      <p>
        Designed and developed by yours truly, <a href="/">joshua.bio</a> is powered by the Liquid templating language, the Jekyll static site generator, and plain HTML/CSS written lovingly from scratch. You can find the entire source code on GitHub, and you are free to reuse and remix my *.scss files however you wish.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This website does not use cookies and makes no attempts to track you. <em>But that's only because there's no need.</em> There are many valid reasons why a website would want to track visitors, and I fully support the <em>ethical</em> use of web trackers.
