This isn't the [homepage](/). You've lost your way.

Please don't panic. Fear will give you a firm shake just to let you know that something is really, *really* important, but beyond that fear is completely useless. So let it pass, then let it go. It's done its job, now the rest is up to you.

Do you remember why you're here? If you don't, that's okay. Purpose is something you make up as you go.

So listen. Why don't you try going back to the [homepage](/)? That might help you get your bearings. If you go back there and you still feel lost, send me a message, and I'll help you out. You'll find plenty of ways to contact me through those links at the top of the [homepage](/).

To be honest, I'm really proud of that [homepage](/). I think it's pretty nice. It has this photo I took of the back of the bus station building in Merced, California. I took it with an iPhone while I was walking home from a cultural celebration at the senior center. I really liked how the puddles looked against the dark earth by the railway. The sky was clear with wisps of cloud. The whole scene really stood out to me, and I wanted to keep it with me forever.

I like seeing photos of cities without people. Images like that put things in stark perspective for me, and evoke subtle emotions inside me that I can't really name. Something bright but wistful. Something that reminds me of someone who likes being alone, but is lonely.

Anyways, I think it makes a good photo for a [homepage](/), don't you agree? The color of the sky works well with the black type. It gives it character, while still keeping it readable. I hope you like it.
