# My mission

I started teaching myself Linux server administration in 2005 by experimenting on a pair of broken laptops that I fixed. I was fifteen years old at the time, and my family had just recently immigrated to the USA from the Philippines. Since then, I've followed along as software developers shifted from interacting with bare iron servers to operating entirely on third-party cloud computing infrastructures.

As internet-based businesses grow more interconnected and interdependent, the risks associated with security breaches and the unethical handling of data have also grown. **I want to do my part to make sure that this revolutionary expansion in the use of networked data proceeds safely, ethically, and responsibly.**

My experience gives me an inside perspective on how data is moved and stored, and on the challenges companies face in meeting privacy and security standards while keeping software products scalable, usable, and globally accessible.

Now, I am in law school to learn the regulatory and legal sides of the puzzle. I believe that combining my technical knowledge with legal expertise will position me well to make an impact in the world of digital privacy.

## Immigration Law

Besides digital privacy, I also want to pursue a specialty in immigration law. Being an immigrant myself, I know how difficult it can be to navigate the immigration system on your own, and so I want to be someone that immigrant families in need can turn to for aid and counsel.
