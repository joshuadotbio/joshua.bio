# My mission

From the moment a software developer starts planning a new application, they begin making decisions that ultimately impact the privacy and security of their users. I want to be the person they can turn to for help in

If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.

You’re disgusting. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.

I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.

Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.

Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
