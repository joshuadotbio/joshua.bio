    <h2>Strengthening my community</h2>
    <p class="">
      I am committed to being a good neighbor. For me, that means engaging in the civic and political life of my community, and listening more than I speak. Being connected to the dreams and challenges of community is among life's most rewarding experiences, and I want to embody it in every aspect of my life.

    <h2>Increasing my capacity</h2>
    <p class="">
      Good intentions are not enough. We need competent and reliable people to take on our most critical challenges. That's why I'm committed to lifelong learning and practice, and to continually honing my skills in a way that plays to my strengths.

    <h2>Acting justly and ethically</h2>
    <p class="">
      Communities are built on foundations of trust. I will do my part to uphold that trust by striving to be just, ethical, and fair in every aspect of my conduct, and by developing my ability to perceive when those values are being tested.
