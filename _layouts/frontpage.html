    <h1>Strengthening my community</h1>
    <p>
      I am committed to being a good neighbor. For me, that means engaging in the civic and political life of my community, and listening more than I speak. Being connected to the dreams and challenges of community is among life's most rewarding experiences, and I want to embody it in every aspect of my life.
