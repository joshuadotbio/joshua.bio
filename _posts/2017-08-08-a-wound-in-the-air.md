"I am a wound in the air." That's something I told myself once, at a time when I was suffering a great deal of emotional pain. I was thinking about space then, about how my body occupies space, denying it from other things and other people. I felt at the time that my presence was meaningless, and I pictured myself, skin to marrow, as some sort of profane void, not worth the air I displaced.

## What is the difference between truth and perception?
