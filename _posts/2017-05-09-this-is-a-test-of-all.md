I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.

I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.

My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."

The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.

Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.
