I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.

That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.

When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.

> Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.

I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.

He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.

The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.

Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! You’re disgusting.
